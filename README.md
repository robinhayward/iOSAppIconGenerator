# iOS App Icon Generator

This script will generate all the images Xcode 7 currently requires of your app for submission to the App Store, just replace `SourceIcon1024.png` with a nice big 1024 x 1024 source image of your icon and run the command below.

### Usage

```BASH
./IconGenerator.sh SourceIcon1024.png
```

#### Comments

If there are any missing images just let me know and I will add them.
